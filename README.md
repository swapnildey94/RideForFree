# RideForFree
RideForFree is a hybrid Mobile app that helps riders and advertisers to leverage cab rides as a great platform. Brands across the world look for market validations and recognition. They achieve this by conducting surveys and various other events to understand how a person is reacting to their brand.

RideForFree will help them to do the same with the riders that cab rides with Aggregators like Ola, Uber, Lyft, etc. This app uses Booking ID and APIs from aggregators to allow users to use the app only during the ride. For every marketing activity done by the user during the ride, we reward them with a discount at the end of the Trip. Not just Promises, actual Discounts.
